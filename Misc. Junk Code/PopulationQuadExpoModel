```{r exponential and quadratic pop model before and after 2000}
## Figure out how to do a dummy variable to replace splitting data into two sets##
before2000 = monthly_averages[1:120,]
timeB = time(before2000$Population)
timeB2 = timeB^2
after2000 = monthly_averages[121:360,]
timeA = time(after2000$Population)
timeA2 = timeA^2

## I tried an exponential model first:
popB2000 <- lm(log(before2000$Population)~time(before2000$Population))

summary(popB2000)

popA2000 <- lm(log(after2000$Population)~time(after2000$Population))

summary(popA2000)

## I tried a quadratic model next
popFitQuadB2000 <- lm(before2000$Population~timeB2+timeB, na.action=NULL)

summary(popFitQuadB2000)

popFitQuadA2000 <- lm(after2000$Population~timeA2+timeA, na.action=NULL)

summary(popFitQuadA2000)

## Both models fit. I think the quadratic may be easier to use to detrend, but I'm not sure.
